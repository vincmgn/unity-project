# 🎮 Unity 2D Project

## 📝 Description

The goal is to progress through 4 levels of increasing difficulty. You are alone with your sword. Find the chests containing the teleportation stones in each level to advance!

**⚠️ Attention ! To use the teleporter, you must have the teleportation stone in hand (F2)! ⚠️**

Mutant slimes will be after you, with 3 different types, each with unique abilities. To help you, pickups are present in some destructible objects and dropped by defeated enemies!
